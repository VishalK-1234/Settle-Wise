st.header("1. Identifying the Socially Relevant Issue")
st.markdown("""
In a rapidly growing city like **Delhi NCR**, choosing the right locality to live in is a major challenge. People often struggle to find areas that match their preferences for **safety**, **affordability**, **air quality**, **connectivity**, and **lifestyle options**. This lack of clear, organized, and accessible information creates confusion, often leading people to make suboptimal or uninformed decisions about where to settle.

This challenge is especially significant for people **new to the city** who may not have an established understanding of the different neighborhoods, making it hard to navigate and choose suitable localities.

**Settle Wise** aims to bridge this gap with data-driven insights to help all residents, particularly newcomers, make informed choices confidently.
